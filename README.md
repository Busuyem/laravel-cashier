Whether you want to quickly bootstrap payment processing for your Laravel applications, or you want a way to test supported payment processors, this package's got you covered.
Being opinionated, it comes with [Tailwindcss-powered](http://tailwindcss.com/) blade views, so that you can simply Plug-and-play‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require damms005/laravel-cashier
```

Publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-cashier-config
```

Run `php artisan migrate`

## Usage

Want to take things for a spin? simply visit `/payment/test-drive` üèéÔ∏è.

To use this in your Laravel project, take these steps:

### Step 1

Send a `POST` request to `/payment/details/confirm`.
Check the [InitiatePaymentRequest](src/Http/Requests/InitiatePaymentRequest.php#L28) form request to know the values you are to post to this endpoint. (tip: you can also check [views/test-drive/pay.blade.php](`views/test-drive/pay.blade.php`))

### Step 2

Upon user confirmation of transaction, user is redirected to the appropriate payment handler's gateway.

### Step 3

When user is done with the transaction on the payment handler's end (either successfully paid, or declined transaction), user is redirected
back to `/api/payment/completed`.

If there are additional steps you want to take upon successful payment, listen for `SuccessfulLaravelCahierPaymentEvent`. It will be fired whenever a successful payment occurs, with its corresponding `Payment` model.
